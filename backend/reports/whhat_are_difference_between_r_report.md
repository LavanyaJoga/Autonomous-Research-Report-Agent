# Research Report: whhat are difference between react-native and flutter

## Executive Summary

Summary: React Native and Flutter are both popular frameworks for building cross-platform mobile applications, but they differ in several key aspects. React Native, developed by Facebook, uses JavaScript and relies on native components, while Flutter, developed by Google, uses the Dart language and provides a rich set of customizable widgets. Additionally, Flutter offers a more consistent performance due to its direct compilation to native code, whereas React Native bridges JavaScript to native code, which can sometimes affect performance.
