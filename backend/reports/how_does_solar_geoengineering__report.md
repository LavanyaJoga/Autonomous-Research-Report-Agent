# Research Report: how does solar geoengineering work?

## Executive Summary

Summary: Solar geoengineering works by reflecting a small percentage of the sun's light back into space to reduce global temperatures. This can be achieved through methods such as injecting aerosols into the stratosphere or increasing the reflectivity of clouds and surfaces. These techniques aim to mimic natural processes, like volcanic eruptions, that have historically cooled the Earth.
