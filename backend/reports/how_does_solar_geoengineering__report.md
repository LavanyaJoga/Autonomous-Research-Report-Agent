# Research Report: How does solar geoengineering work

## Executive Summary

Summary: Solar geoengineering involves techniques designed to reflect a portion of the sun's energy back into space to reduce global temperatures. This can be achieved through methods such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which disperses particles like sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere to increase the Earth's albedo, or marine cloud brightening, which enhances the reflectivity of clouds over the ocean. These approaches aim to mitigate the effects of climate change, but they also carry potential risks and uncertainties regarding their environmental and geopolitical impacts.
