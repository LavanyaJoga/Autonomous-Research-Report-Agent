# Research Report: Compare renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

## Executive Summary

Summary: Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are key components in reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to sustainable energy systems. Solar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells, while wind power generates electricity through turbines driven by wind. Both sources are abundant and produce minimal environmental impact, but they require different infrastructure and are subject to variability based on weather conditions and geographic location.
