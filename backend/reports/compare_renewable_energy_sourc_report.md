# Research Report: Compare renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

## Executive Summary

Summary: Solar and wind power are two of the most prominent renewable energy sources, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Solar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells, making it highly effective in sunny regions, while wind power generates electricity through turbines driven by wind, suitable for areas with consistent wind patterns. Both sources contribute to reducing carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, but their efficiency and implementation depend on geographic and climatic conditions.
