# Research Report: What evidence exists for and against the gut-brain connection in mental health disorders?

## Executive Summary

Summary: Evidence supporting the gut-brain connection in mental health disorders includes studies showing that gut microbiota can influence brain function and behavior through the gut-brain axis, with alterations in gut microbiota linked to conditions like depression and anxiety. Conversely, evidence against this connection highlights the complexity of mental health disorders, suggesting that while gut microbiota may play a role, it is only one of many factors, and causality remains difficult to establish due to the multifactorial nature of these disorders.
