# Research Report: Explain quantum computing in simple terms

## Executive Summary

Summary: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can represent and store information in multiple states simultaneously, potentially allowing them to solve certain complex problems much faster than classical computers.
